# Malware's Unity Spring Class
A Unity Spring Class ported to C# from lua.

Allows for smooth easing for floats and Vector3s, while being easier to use than standard Lerp loops, with a better looking result.

## Features
* Features springs for ``float`` and ``Vector3``.
* Requires no manual update calls, as it uses the time of requests to calculate values.
* Easy to set up, while not cluttering your other scripts with dozens of unneeded variables.
